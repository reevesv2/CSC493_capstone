# *CHORD - Suggestion App*
## Description/Motivation

My project proposal is to build a chord suggestion web appication. This web application will be useful for musicians who are composing music because it will suggest ways for them to make their chord progressions more advanced and complex. The interesting/fun aspect is in the process of allowing composers and musicians to get creative.
